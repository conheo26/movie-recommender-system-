# Movie Recommender System 🎥🤖

## Introduction

This project aims to build a personalized movie recommender system to enhance the user experience on streaming platforms. With countless options available, finding the perfect movie can be daunting. This system uses machine learning techniques to deliver accurate and tailored movie recommendations. 🎬

### Motivation 💡

The project addresses:
- **Understanding User Preferences**: Accurately adapting to users' changing tastes.
- **Cold Start Problem**: Handling new users or movies with minimal interaction data.
- **Diversity and Serendipity**: Balancing popular and niche content to encourage user exploration.

### Main Contributions ⚙️
- **Baseline Predictor**: Estimates user-item ratings using overall averages and biases.
- **Collaborative Filtering**: User-based and item-based methods to recommend movies based on similar user preferences or attributes.

## Dataset 📊

The project utilizes the **MovieLens Latest Datasets**, which contain:
- **100,836** 5-star ratings for **9,742 movies** by **610 users** (March 1996 – September 2018).
- Each user has rated at least 20 movies.

### Key Features:
- File format: `ratings.csv`
- Contains user-item interactions.

## Literature Review 📚

Inspired by **The BellKor Solution** to the Netflix Grand Prize:
- Techniques: **Time-changing baseline predictors**, **Matrix factorization with temporal dynamics**.

## Proposed Solution 💡

### Key Approaches:
1. **Baseline Predictor**:
   - Uses user-item biases and averages to estimate ratings.
2. **Collaborative Filtering**:
   - Learns user and item embeddings from the feedback matrix.
   - Simultaneously considers user-user and item-item similarities.
3. **Incorporating Genre Effects**:
   - Genre embeddings influence predictions.
4. **Gravity Loss**:
   - A global prior that regularizes user-item interactions to improve generalization.
5. **Regularization**:
   - Penalizes large estimates from small datasets to avoid overfitting.

### Objective Function:
Optimizes the sum of squared errors over observed entries in the feedback matrix.

## Implementation 💻

The system is implemented using machine learning techniques, focusing on:
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Exploits user-item relationships for recommendations.
- **Content-based Filtering**: Enhances predictions using movie metadata.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
  - Uses grid search for regularization constants and embedding dimensions.

---

## Evaluation & Improvement 📈

### Advantages:
- Requires no prior domain knowledge.
- Supports serendipitous recommendations based on similar user behaviors.
- Operates effectively with only a feedback matrix.

### Disadvantages:
- **Cold-start Problem**: Lacks embeddings for unseen users/items during training.
- Limited inclusion of additional features like country or language.

### Improvements:
- Combines collaborative filtering with content-based methods.
- Accounts for temporal effects (e.g., popularity shifts due to events).
- Uses cross-validation for hyperparameter optimization.
